708	Bishop Aubert had a shrine built on this mountain in honor of the Archangel Saint-Michel (who, according to legend, appeared to him and ordered him to do so). The skull of Abbot Aubert rests today in the basilica of Avranches. This sanctuary had in fact the shape of a small cave, which can only contain about a hundred faithful.	https://i.imgur.com/SDxoNPY.png https://i.imgur.com/58Iltu3.png|Martine Laurence-Barre		
709	In 709, a small village was also built on the mountain. Towards the middle of the Middle Ages, this village will fill up more and more, following the Viking incursions. Indeed, the Mount will be the preferred escape route for civilians to escape the massacre perpetrated by the Vikings in Normandy. Aubert had a small church built on the top of Mont Tombe, a draft of what would become the abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel in the years to come. The Canons, who were the monks who populated the Abbey at the time of Bishop Aubert, welcomed pilgrims for two centuries, but they gradually neglected their mission.

1154	Robert Thorigny was elected Abbot of the Mont in 1154. During his regency, the Mont acquired many books, books at that time being objects of great value, which only reinforced the wealth of the Mont. Being a writer himself, he wrote some of them. Being also a great builder, he had many buildings constructed, such as a larger chaplaincy that was able to accommodate more pilgrims. When he died in 1184, the abbot left behind a powerful and spiritually influential abbey.  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)	https://i.imgur.com/LKXmGvB.png
